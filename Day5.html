            <p><span class="ans">Answer:</span>
                clean up function: this function gets executed when the component is unmounted from the screen. This is mostly used for memory leaks.
                 //componentWillUnmount : Cleanup function in useEffect. useEffect(() =>{ console.log("Inside useEffect hook");
   <pre class="pre">
    return function cleanup() {
        console.log("componentWillUnmount is happen...!")
    }
  })

        </div>
        <div>
            <p><span class="ans">useCallback:</span>
                useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.
                <br><br>
                <span class="ans">useMemo:</span>
                useMemo that allows to memoize expensive functions so that accepts a second parameter to declare dependencies. The expensive function will only run when its dependencies have changed.

        <div>
            <p><span class="ans">Answer:</span>
                Keys help React identify which items have changed (added/removed/re-ordered). To give a unique identity to every element inside the array, a key is required.
